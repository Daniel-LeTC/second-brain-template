## Reminders

morning/stretching = downward dog to cobra stretch
morning physical health involves calesthenic
meal-type: protein, carbohydrates or general
meal-name: should have recipe sop
meal-feedback: tell about meal, was it tasty, or not were you satisfied etc


We would be using digestive supplements only with protein shakes and other so that we don't have addiction to it, like to eat stuff we don't need to rely on syrups. This is not a hard and fast rule, because if syrups are making you eat then eat. But try to eat food without them first, if failed then go back to syrups

productivity is the key to rate the day of productivity


outsourced-to-harsh:

> The increment for this key will only occur if Harsh completes the outsourced work entirely on his own. It implies that he should not begin the task and then inform me to finish the remaining portion. Additionally, it does not imply that I outsourced the work and Harsh provided excuses for its poor quality without actually completing it. Such actions will not be considered and will not result in any increments.
